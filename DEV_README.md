# youngs developer documentation

Developer documentation for the software **youngs**. For user documentation, contact and license please see the file `README.MD`.

## Unit tests

Unit tests should be developed for all standalone functionality. The are automatically run during `mvn test`.


## Integration test

Integration tests for sources and/or sinks require an internet connection to an existing catalogue. An Elasticsearch sink can automatically be started using the system property `test.start.elasticsearch`, see `pom.xml` and class `org.n52.youngs.test.ElasticsearchServer`.

To run integration tests, activate the profile `integration-test`: `mvn verify -Pintegration-test`.


## Index management

During development, the following commands can be handy to delete indices and types when running an external Elasticsearch database. Commands are tested in [Cmder](http://cmder.net/).

* `curl -v -Method Delete 'http://localhost:9200/testindex/'` (see [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-delete-index.html)


## Perform a release

youngs uses the 52Â°North parent POM (https://github.com/52North/maven-parents), so all required configuration is readily available.

### Preparations

Put your [Sonatype OSS](https://oss.sonatype.org/) credentials into your `.m2/settings.xml` like this:

```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                              http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>ossrh</id>
            <username>$username</username>
            <password>$password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

You also need a public key on a keyserver (see [here](https://www.debian-administration.org/article/451/Submitting_your_GPG_key_to_a_keyserver) for upload instructions), which you then use to sign the release. Check the if the signing works by running `mvn clean install -Psign`.

### Release

First, merge your development branch with the upstream's master branch.

```sh
git checkout develop
git merge upstream/master
```

Optional: Switch to a special branch to prepare the release. Afterward you can merge this new branch into you local master or develop branch. This means that the release is performed against the default remote (normally a fork). Otherwise, the upstream repo will have a develop branch, which can also be fine.

```sh
git checkout -b release-prepare
```

Now start the release process with

```sh
mvn release:clean elease:prepare
```

The `release` commands are interactive and allow you to set the release version and next development version. Have your GitHub credentials ready, because the plugin will create the required tags and push changes to the repo.

After this command, set the `master` branch to the version with the release tag, e.g. `v1.1.0`.

```sh
git checkout master
git reset --hard v1.1.0
```

Push the changes to your fork.

```sh
git push origin
```

Create a pull request from your fork's `master` branch to the main repository `master` branch.

Optional (see above): Switch to the develop branch and merge with `release-prepare` branch, so that you have the current development version.

Next, switch back to the `master` branch to perform the actual release, i.e. uploading to Maven Central. Please check for the correct version in the POM file to make sure.

```sh
mvn release:perform -P sign
```

Finally, delete the `release-prepare` branch if you used it, checkout the development branch, and merge with upstream master to continue the development.

```sh
git branch -d release-prepare
git checkout develop
git merge upstream/master
```

After performing the release on the command line, log in to Sonatype Nexus at https://oss.sonatype.org/ and complete the following steps:

* Locate the project in the the staging repository: https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
* Check it contains the required files (pom, asc, sources, javadoc, ...)
* "Close" the staging repository to continue the process by selecting the checkbox and clicking the respective buttom at the top. Wait for the closing to finish - you can observe the progress in the "Activity" tab, but you might have to refresh the page. A successful close ends with the message "Repository closed"
* Select the repository and click on "Release", then refresh - the staging repo should be gone.
* Check after a short delay (few minutes) for the published modules at http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/n52/youngs/
